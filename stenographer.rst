Stenographer
============

From https://github.com/google/stenographer:

    Stenographer is a full-packet-capture utility for buffering packets to disk for intrusion detection and incident response purposes. It provides a high-performance implementation of NIC-to-disk packet writing, handles deleting those files as disk fills up, and provides methods for reading back specific sets of packets quickly and easily.

Stenographer uses :ref:`af-packet` for packet acquisition.

Output
------

Stenographer writes full packet capture to ``/nsm/pcap/``. It will automatically start purging old data once the partition reaches 90%. This value is configurable as shown in the Configuration section below.

Analysis
--------

You can access full packet capture via the :ref:`pcap` interface:

.. image:: images/pcap-transcript.png
  :target: _images/pcap-transcript.png

:ref:`alerts`, :ref:`dashboards`, :ref:`hunt`, and :ref:`kibana` allow you to easily pivot to the :ref:`pcap` interface.

Command Line
------------

You can also access packet capture from the command line of the box where the pcap is stored using a steno query as defined at https://github.com/google/stenographer#querying. In the following examples, replace "YourStenoQueryHere" with your actual steno query.

The first option is using docker to run ``stenoread``. If the query succeeds, you can then find the resulting pcap file in ``/nsm/pcaptmp/`` in the host filesystem:

::

    sudo docker exec -it so-steno stenoread "YourStenoQueryHere" -w /tmp/new.pcap

We've included a wrapper script called ``so-pcap-export`` to make this a little easier. For example:

::

    sudo so-pcap-export "YourStenoQueryHere" output.pcap
    
If the query succeeds, you can then find the resulting pcap file in ``/nsm/pcapout/`` in the host filesystem.

Configuration
-------------

Stenographer reads its configuration from ``/opt/so/conf/steno/``. However, please keep in mind that if you make any changes to this directory they may be overwritten since the configuration is managed with :ref:`salt`.

For example, suppose you want to change the default value for purging old pcap. You could add the ``diskfreepercentage`` option in the ``steno`` section of the :ref:`salt` pillar and set the value to something appropriate for your system. For example:

::

	steno:
  	  diskfreepercentage: 20

Below is a table of all of the salt options for stenographer, including customised options specific to our environment. To configure a salt option, refer to the example above.

Maximum Files
-------------

By default, Stenographer limits the number of files in the pcap directory to ``30000`` to avoid limitations with the ext3 filesystem. However, if you're using the ext4 or xfs filesystems, then it is safe to increase this value. So if you have a large amount of storage and find that you only have 3 weeks worth of PCAP on disk while still having plenty of free space, then you may want to increase this default setting. To do so, you can add the ``maxfiles`` option in the ``steno`` section of the :ref:`salt` pillar and set the value to something appropriate for your system. For example:

::

	steno:
	  maxfiles: 120000

Diagnostic Logging
------------------

Diagnostic logging for Stenographer can be found at ``/opt/so/log/stenographer/``. Depending on what you're looking for, you may also need to look at the :ref:`docker` logs for the container:

::

	sudo docker logs so-steno

Disabling
---------

If you need to disable Stenographer, you can do so in two different ways. If you just want to disable it on a single sensor, then you can edit that sensor's ``minion.sls`` file. If the file doesn't already have a ``steno`` section, then add the following to the end of the file:

::

	steno:
	  enabled: false

If you want to disable Stenographer globally across all your sensors, then you can add that entry to your ``global.sls`` file.

VLAN tags
---------

.. warning::

   | Please note that Stenographer should correctly record traffic on a VLAN but won't log the actual VLAN tags due to the way that :ref:`af-packet` works:
